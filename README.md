Illegal Logging Detection with Drones
📌 Project Overview

Illegal logging causes severe environmental damage, biodiversity loss, and climate impact. This project leverages drone imagery and AI-based computer vision to automatically detect illegal logging activities in forest areas, enabling faster monitoring and enforcement.

🚀 Features

Drone-based aerial image acquisition

Image preprocessing and augmentation

AI/ML model for detecting deforested areas

Identification of suspicious logging patterns

Synthetic data support for model training

🧠 Technologies Used

Python

NumPy, Pandas

OpenCV

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Drone imagery (synthetic or real)
